#### How It Works
- Connects two types of users:
  - **Drivers**: Can search, book, and pay for parking spaces in advance or on the spot.
  - **Parking Space Owners**: Can list their available spaces and earn income from them.
- The system handles reservations, payments, and provides navigation to the parking spot.
